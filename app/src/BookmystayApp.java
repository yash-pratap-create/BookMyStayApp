 * Use Case 1: Application Entry & Welcome Message
 *
 * Description:
 * This class represents the entry point of the
 * Hotel Booking Management System.
 *
 * At this stage, the application:
 * - Starts execution from the main() method
 * - Displays a welcome message to the user
 * - Confirms that the system has started successfully
 *
 * No business logic, data structures, or user input
 * is implemented in this use case.
 *
 * The goal is to establish a clear and predictable
 * application startup point.
